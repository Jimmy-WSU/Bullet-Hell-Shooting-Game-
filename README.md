# Bullet-Hell-Shooting-Game-
â€¢	Basically, we create a bullet shooting game. In this game, we are using C# as our building language. Our teams have four members, we separate the task to ourselves. Everyone has taken care of what they are good at. For example, I am building the design pattern which we are using Factory Pattern.
